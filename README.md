# Description
This repository contains three playgrounds that show how you can use docker and docker compose to 
develop and test applications locally.

## Playgrounds
Use the `Makefile` directives to build and run containers. These are the topics covered in the playgrounds:
- Build and run a Go web application using a **simple** Dockerfile
- Build and run the same application using a **multistage** Dockerfile
- Run a Redis container and a Python Flask web application using **docker compose**

Refer to the documentation in each folder to learn how to build and run the applications.
